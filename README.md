# Algorithms and Data Structures

This topic is a clich√© and for a very good reason: it's absolutely essential knowledge. 

Besides being essential it's also very interesting and rewarding to learn and there's no better way to learn something than to jump into the nitty-gritty of it. In this case that means implementing the Data Structures and Algorithms from scratch in Ruby.

Why Ruby you might ask? Well, a language it's just a tool to an end and not an end by itself.

## Data Structures

- [Linked Lists](./LinkedList/SinglyLinkedList)
    - [Singly Linked List](./LinkedList/SinglyLinkedList/singly_linked_list.rb)
- [Stack](./Stack/stack.rb)
- [Queue](./Queue/queue.rb)
- [MinStack](./MinStack/minstack.rb)
